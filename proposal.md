Feedback-bot is addressing a prominent problem for the students at Make School.
During intensives and lightning talks, students are encouraged to give each other feedback.
The feedback is provided on small pieces of papaer, making it easy to lose and difficult to find patterns in it.

Feedback is a Slack utility that provides a structured blueprint for students to send eachother feedback.
Furthermore it keeps track of all previous feedback a student has received
With a simple command, Feedback-bot provides all previous feedback received by a student in google sheet format,
making it easy to find patterns and improve!
